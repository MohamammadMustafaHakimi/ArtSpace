1. Things I learned:
-> 1. Column
   Main axis = vertical → control spacing along this axis with verticalArrangement.
   Cross axis = horizontal → control alignment across this axis with horizontalAlignment.

   2. Row
   Main axis = horizontal → control spacing along this axis with horizontalArrangement.
   Cross axis = vertical → control alignment across this axis with verticalAlignment.

-> (alt + j) is used to select similar strings; simply select a string and then alt plus j
